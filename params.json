  "body": "# MorePass\r\nWebExtension for Chrome, Firefox and Edge to manage passwords on multiple devices\r\n\r\n## What?\r\nMorePass allows you to manage your passwords, encrypt them locally and store that encrypted vault on a server (it's not a cloud, it's just a server).\r\n\r\n## Secure?\r\nSee for yourself. Read the sourcecode (it's just javascript) and report any bugs you find. MorePass uses the native crypto.subtle.encrypt function in the browser to encrypt and decrypt with AES-CBC.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nBecause LastPass is starting to fustrate me. Do you know they can now recover your stuff when you lost your master passphrase? Also the interface just bugs me.\r\n\r\n## How to use?\r\nWhile in development, you can clone or download this WebExtension, then for Chrome go to chrome://extensions/ , enable \"Developer mode\" and then \"Load unpacked extension...\". Point it to the root of the MorePass folder/dir you just created.\r\nFor Firefox, go to about:debugging , check the \"Enable add-on debugging\" box and click \"Load Temporary Addon\". Select the manifest.json file and open it.",
